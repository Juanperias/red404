# Docker
# For local dev, we don't ignore volumes, but if you have specific build outputs
# that are *not* intended for source control, list them here.
# Docker build context itself is managed by .dockerignore (if present in specific service dirs)

# Database
# If you have local DB dumps or specific DB client configs you don't want committed
# For PostgreSQL:
# pg_data/
# *.sql.bak
