# Go
/backend/tmp/ # Temporary build directory for air/Go
/backend/main # Compiled binary for Go (assuming 'main' is your default name)
/backend/bin/ # Any other compiled binaries
/backend/.air.toml # Air configuration, if you choose to keep it local to dev env
/backend/go.sum # Can sometimes be ignored if you rely on go.mod and go mod download always

# Node.js / React / Vite
/frontend/node_modules/
/frontend/dist/ # Vite build output
/frontend/.vite/ # Vite cache directory

# Docker
# For local dev, we don't ignore volumes, but if you have specific build outputs
# that are *not* intended for source control, list them here.
# Docker build context itself is managed by .dockerignore (if present in specific service dirs)

# Database
# If you have local DB dumps or specific DB client configs you don't want committed
# For PostgreSQL:
# pg_data/
# *.sql.bak
